# LoopSniffer

LoopSniffer is a cross-platform music search tool built to uncover the full landscape of a track — official releases, remixes, edits, 
bootlegs, covers, live versions, and even appearances in DJ sets. 

Enter any song and LoopSniffer will sweep across YouTube Music, Spotify, and SoundCloud to surface alternate versions using smart filters 
and search logic.

Whether you're a DJ looking for extended edits, a fan tracking down a bootleg, or a music nerd who wants every version of a track ever 
released — LoopSniffer digs it up.
